      <p>Our goal is to be able to create a forum for learning and discussing mental health. We know that with the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, many students are experiencing more stress and anxiety and it is importatnt to promote and learn ways to protect our minds as much as our bodies.</p>

      <br>

      <h1>Operation Smile</h1>
      <p>Contact Maddie Burton and Gilli Aronson</p>
      <p>Operation smile is a club at SHS which helps raise money to donate to a larger organization also called Operation Smile. They provide live-saving surgeries that reconstruct cleft palates and lips for kids all around the world. Why do they happen, you may ask? A child being born with a cleft palate is not an uncommon thing: it can occur alone or as a genetic condition or syndrome. It is a split opening in the roof of the mouth and/or lip. It can cause difficulty speaking, feeding, and even insecurities. Surgery helps reconstruct the lip with minimal scarring and restore normal function, and of course the ability to smile! Our club fundraises for this organization. With the money we raise, more surgeries can happen. Every $240 raised transforms a life and restores a smile. Although many students may be fully remote, there are still ways to fundraise online. Both in school and online fundraising will occur and we can think of ideas how to do it together!</p>
